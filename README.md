# LoginPage-Servlet
In this project, I have created the login page using JSP, servlet, and mysql. Simply I created the username and password, and after the one login button to login and added one message if login credentials are right then it shows login successfully and if the credential is wrong then I have created one try again button, directly goto the login page.
